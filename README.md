# BREAD Architecture
A CPU architecture (WORK IN PROGRESS)<br/>
Architecture: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElCRIVdjZPaOfBtRwQR4t3v-fzibioF6beGbO_hnlzw/edit?usp=sharing<br/>
# Notes
I might add more instructions in the future.<br/><br/>
If anyone wants to make an assembler that would be cool.<br/><br/>
I am making the emulator.<br/><br/>
Does anyone know how to port the linux kernel, I know how to port software (By hand), and where can I even find the source code for the kernel
